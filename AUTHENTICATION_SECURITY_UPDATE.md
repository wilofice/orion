# Authentication Security Update Summary

## Security Issue Identified:
Several API routes were unprotected and allowed access to any user's data by simply knowing their user_id. This was a major security vulnerability.

## Routes Updated with Authentication:

### 1. **events_router.py**
- `GET /events/{user_id}/upcoming` - Now requires JWT authentication
- `GET /events/{user_id}/busy-slots` - Now requires JWT authentication
- Added authorization check: Users can only access their own calendar events

### 2. **user_preferences_router.py**
- `POST /preferences/{user_id}` - Now requires JWT authentication
- `GET /preferences/{user_id}` - Now requires JWT authentication
- `PUT /preferences/{user_id}` - Now requires JWT authentication
- `DELETE /preferences/{user_id}` - Now requires JWT authentication
- Added authorization check: Users can only manage their own preferences

### 3. **conversation_router.py**
- `GET /conversations/{user_id}` - Now requires JWT authentication
- Added authorization check: Users can only access their own conversations

## Implementation Details:

### Authentication Flow:
1. All protected endpoints now include `current_user_id: str = Depends(verify_token)`
2. The `verify_token` function extracts the user_id from the JWT token
3. Each endpoint verifies that `current_user_id == user_id` (from the path)
4. If the user tries to access another user's data, a 403 Forbidden error is returned

### Example of Protected Endpoint:
```python
@router.get("/{user_id}/upcoming", response_model=EventsResponse)
async def get_upcoming_events(
    user_id: str,
    days: int = 7,
    timezone: str = "UTC",
    current_user_id: str = Depends(verify_token)  # JWT authentication
) -> EventsResponse:
    # Authorization check
    if current_user_id != user_id:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="You can only access your own calendar events"
        )
    # ... rest of the implementation
```

## Routes That Remain Unprotected:

### auth_router.py:
- `POST /auth/google/connect` - Must remain unprotected for initial authentication
- This is the entry point where users exchange Google OAuth codes for JWT tokens

### chat_router.py:
- `GET /chat/` - Root endpoint for health check (marked as `include_in_schema=False`)

## Security Benefits:
1. **Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints now require valid JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Audit Trail**: All unauthorized access attempts are logged
4. **Consistent Security**: Same security pattern applied across all routers

## Client Usage:
Clients must include the JWT token in the Authorization header for all protected endpoints:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>" \
     https://api.example.com/events/{user_id}/upcoming
```
